I will give you a list of words, and I want you to make new dialogues contain ONLY  words from this list. You will output the new dialogues in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "words": [ /* words from the original list that you're going to use in the dialogue */ ],
    "preview": [
      "A: 马先生在家里写信。",
      "B: 老马！你现在作什么？",
      "A: 我正在写信！",
      /* more dialogue lines here -- dialogues should be 8-12 lines long */
    ],
    "lines": [
      {
        "s": "A",
        "c": "马先生在家里写信。",
        "p": "Mǎ Xiānsheng zài jiāli xiěxìn.",
        "t": "Господин Ма дома пишет письмо.",
        "d": "先生 (xiānsheng) - \"Прежде рожденный\"; 家里 (jiāli) - семья + внутри"
      },
      {
        "s": "B",
        "c": "老马！你现在作什么？",
        "p": "Lǎo Mǎ! Nǐ xiànzài zuò shénme?",
        "t": "Старина Ма! Ты сейчас что делаешь?"
      },
      {
        "s": "A",
        "c": "我正在写信！",
        "p": "Wǒ zhèngzài xiěxìn!",
        "t": "Я как раз пишу письмо!",
        "d": "正在 (zhèngzài) служит для выражения продолжающегося действия"
      }
      /* more dialogue lines here */
    ],
    "title": "В гостях у Ма"
  },
  /* more dialogues here */
]
```
    
Each dialogue line is as follows:
```
{
  "s": "speaker id (e.g A, B)",
  "c": "chinese text", 
  "p": "pinyin",
  "t": "russian translation",
  "d": "optional commentary"
}
```

Note that the optional commentary doesn't just have to be translations of words, but may make other remarks, having to do with idioms, grammar, expressions, and even cultural notes.

When outputting JSON, pay attention to escaping characters, such as quotes, properly.

Especially pay attention to escaping quotes around Chinese characters. You often make mistakes in cases like the below:
```
{
 "c": "我去年开始看"红楼梦"！",
 }
```
This is invalid JSON and instead should be
```
{
 "c": "我去年开始看\"红楼梦\"！",
 }
```

Try to make dialogues interesting. Be creative!

Each dialogue must be 8-12 lines long.

Try to make dialogues a bit more complicated while still using the same words:
- Using longer descriptive phrases
- Combining multiple actions in single sentences
- Using more complex sentence structures than the ones used in the example dialogues on top.
- Creating more intricate scenarios with multiple characters and locations
- Using longer explanations of situations

Generate multiple dialogues at a time.
Make the dialogues humorous and entertaining wherever possible.

Give each dialogue a title in Russian, not in Chinese.
